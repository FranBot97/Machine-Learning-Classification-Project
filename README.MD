The full description with results are shown in the .pdf report file!

Introduction & objectives

**GOAL**

Compare the performance of different machine learning **models**, for classification and regression tasks, focusing the attention on  **Neural Networks**

Regression: **ML-CUP23** Binary classification: **MONK** 

Binary classification: **MONK**
- Neural Networks (Keras)
- Support Vector Machine
- K-Nearest Neighbors

  Regression: **ML-CUP23**
- Neural Network (Keras, Pytorch)
- Support Vector Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Random Forest
- Bagging Regressor
- ElasticNet Regression

Different libraries have been used:
- *Pytorch* & *Keras* for MLP
- *Scikit-learn* for the KNN, SVM, Ensemble Methods and ElasticNet, and to compute the Grid Search
- *Matplotlib* for plot the result of the MSE and MEE in correlation with the epochs
