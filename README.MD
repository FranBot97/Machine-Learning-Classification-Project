**GOAL![](Aspose.Words.32dcb5d3-b561-46e3-a669-a6a70f94ae7c.002.png)**

Compare the performance of 

different machine learning **models**, 

for classification and regression 

tasks, focusing the attention on  **DATASETS Neural Networks  ![](Aspose.Words.32dcb5d3-b561-46e3-a669-a6a70f94ae7c.003.png)**

Regression: **ML-CUP23** Binary classification: **MONK** 

Methods: models
Binary classification: **MONK 
- Neural Networks (Keras)
- Support Vector Machine
- K-Nearest Neighbors

  Regression: **ML-CUP23**
- Neural Network (Keras, Pytorch)
- Support Vector Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Random Forest
- Bagging Regressor
- ElasticNet Regression

Different libraries have been used:

- *Pytorch* & *Keras* for MLP
- *Scikit-learn* for the KNN, SVM, Ensemble Methods and ElasticNet, and to compute the Grid Search
- *Matplotlib* for plot the result of the MSE and MEE in correlation with the epochs
